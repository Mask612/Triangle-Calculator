# Triangle-Calculator
calculates sides and angles of a triangle when given minimum amount of information (3 values at least  has to be a side and 1 angle)

This program is helpful especially in math classes when you have to do trigonometry. Sadly I got the idea to make this after my class was 
over but maybe it can help someone else. Enjoy!
